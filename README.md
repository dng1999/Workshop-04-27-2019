<h1>
Machine Learning Club - Binary Image Classification Solved via Deep Learning
</h1> 

<p>
In this workshop we will go through the very basics of Deep Learning. Unfortunately, the theory why this works is out of scope of the workshop. Nonetheless, we will make your time worthwhile because we're working on image classification with a small dataset (generally, 
hard thing to do in the Deep Learning paradigm), and yet with accuracy above 80%.

How To Run This Project
</h2>

<p>Open your terminal (command prompt) and navigate to a directory where you want to store this project. While in that directory type the following into your terminal (command prompt): </p>
<ol>
<li>git clone https://github.com/pholoubek/Workshop-04-27-2019</li>
<li>cd Workshop-04-27-2019/project</li>
<li>python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate</li>
<li>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</li>
<li>jupyter notebook</li>
</ol>

<p>After the last command 'jupyter notebook', in your web browser should appear a window with the ImageConvNet file. Open it and have fun.  </p>
