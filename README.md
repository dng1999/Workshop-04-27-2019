<h1>
Machine Learning Club - Binary Image Classification Solved via Deep Learning
</h1> 

<p>
In this workshop we will go through the very basics of Deep Learning. Unfortunately, the theory why this works is out of scope of the workshop. Nonetheless, we will make your time worthwhile because we're working on image classification with a small dataset (generally, 
hard thing to do in the Deep Learning paradigma), and yet with award winning accuracy.
